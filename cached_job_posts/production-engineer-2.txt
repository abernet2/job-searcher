      About Us:
     </b>
<p>
      Braintree builds products that make payments easier—so easy that they fade into the background, making entirely new kinds of interactions possible. Interactions like seamlessly paying for your ride share -- or the condo you rented this weekend -- without presenting a card or pressing a button, or buying a lamp on Pinterest...right

<p>
      Our Production team is growing! The Production Engineers embrace Unix systems -- from the production clusters down to the desktop.

You will find us swimming in technical solutions that keep the business engaged and moving forward.

      Our team does work that ranges from debugging dynamic routing protocols, writing nagios checks for an NTP servers, to tweaking the office 802.11b channels to avoid a noisy microwave all in the same day. Our responsibility is to ensure the technology supports and accelerates our business. Stability, scalability, fault tolerance, and automation are key properties of our solutions. We strive to provide our clients with 100% system availability, as we don't make money unless our clients do.
