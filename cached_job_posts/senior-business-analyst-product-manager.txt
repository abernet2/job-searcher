    About the role:
   </b>
<p>
    Our business analysts don’t just ask what a client wants. They ask “what if we did it this way?” They’re big-picture thinkers. Strategic problem-solvers. Savvy team players with a passion for the process of software development. And we’re looking for a standout candidate to join them.
   </p>
<p>
    As a senior business analyst with The Mx Group, you’ll serve as the primary point of contact for our clients and help them shape and plan digital projects. You’ll manage the development of brand-new applications as well as updates to existing systems. You’ll oversee the full lifecycle of development projects, keeping them on-scope and on-budget. Working with an experienced, enthusiastic team of software developers and analysts, you’ll produce applications our diverse client base — and their customers — can’t do without.
    <br/>

<em>
     Note: At The Mx Group, we call this role “business analyst,” but we’re looking for people with the right characteristics — not necessarily the same title. Whether you call yourself a BA, a project manager, a product owner or something else, we want to talk to you!
     <br/>
