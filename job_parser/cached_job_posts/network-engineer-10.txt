   We are looking for an experienced Network Engineer to assist in maintaining our network reliability and lead improvement projects in our effort to change the mortgage industry completely!
   <p>
    The Financial technology space "Fintech" space is booming and Guaranteed Rate is at the center of it. We are focused on automating the mortgage process for consumers. Imagine getting a mortgage with no email, no faxing, no stack of papers in 10 days or less instead of 30 or more!! If you have been through the process of buying a home, you know how amazing this will be. We are the #8 lender in the country and one of only 2 that is independent (not a bank) so we are in a good spot to win this race. We have already made tremendous strides and we are looking for someone who wants to help us finish the job and disrupt the entire industry.

<strong>
     Who is GR?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Guaranteed Rate is not your typical company and certainly not your typical mortgage company. We are young, technology driven, have tons of energy and we love what we do – get people and great priced mortgages alongside our impeccable customer service. We’re in a River North office with exposed brick and duct work, windows we can actually open during the summer and an open floor plan – no cubicle life here.

    </li>
<li>
     Game room, library and white board paint for collaboration – yeah, it’s awesome.
    </li>
<li>
     Access to our free GR nurse practitioner. Psshh who needs a doctor’s appointment when our nurse can do it all? Did we mention the free part?
    </li>
<li>
     401k with some matching, Blue Cross health care coverage – yup, dental and vision too, short-term disability, life insurance – we got ya covered on this one, legal assistance – for a small monthly fee.
