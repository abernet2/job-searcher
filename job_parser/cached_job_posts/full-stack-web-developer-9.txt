    We are looking for a highly-motivated, skilled developer 
to fill the role of Web Developer.  As a Web Developer, you will work 
closely with Product Management, a Graphic Artist, and Marketing to create and

    We at Microsystems are strong believers in a 
healthy work-life balance with added benefits you don’t find everywhere. Work 
hours are flexible, and there are many opportunities to relax and get to know 
each other, such as sports leagues, Thirsty Thursdays, and chair massages.   From Cinco de Mayo to Halloween to Festivus,
there is always a reason to share a meal and celebrate! Microsystems cares 
about all employees; we offer an annual onsite Wellness Event, our work 
environment and attire are very casual, and free drinks and fruit are provided 
daily. Meetings are minimal and you are always appreciated by management. We 
are dedicated to giving back to the community. The team participates in an
